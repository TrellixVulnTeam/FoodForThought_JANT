<ul>
<li>To create a simple portal to share motivational quotes from registered users</li>

</ul>

The following are the components present in the project
<ol>
<li>Home page</li>
<li>Registration page</li>
<li>Login page</li>

</ol>

A user can register into this site by providing necessary details, as well as by entering a mandatory article on their take on mental health. Once it is done, they can login using their credentials, and they would be redirected to the dashboard. This site comprises of the following parts:
<ul>
<li>Statistics about users</li>
<li>A section to add a new article</li>
